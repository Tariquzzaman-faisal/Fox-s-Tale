# Fox's Tale
The game is a recreation of the classic game Rapid Roll. We modified the game a bit by adding a Fox as our main character and also introduced various types of power ups as well. We also introduced multiple difficulty levels with different backgrounds to give a more immersive view.

One thing that old classic games did so well was that they were so simple and yet much fun to play. Such a game was Rapid Roll. But as of now, there is no PC version of the game. If we want to play the game, we need to use emulators which is not optimal at all. So we decided to create our own version of it with our own twists and turns, something that is handcrafted by us
